## 🌟 Beyond the Coursework
While this project started as a capstone requirement, I extended the functionality significantly beyond the provided instructions to create a complete product experience:

* **Dynamic Cart Badge:** Implemented a real-time notification badge on the cart icon that updates instantly when items are added (using StateFlow).
* **Navigation Drawer:** Designed and integrated a custom "Hamburger Menu" side bar for seamless navigation between screens.
* **Enhanced Navigation Logic:** Built a robust navigation graph that allows users to return to the Home screen from any point, managing the back stack correctly.
* **Cart Summary Logic:** Developed a dedicated Cart Screen that aggregates items and calculates the total price dynamically, which was not part of the original starter code.
